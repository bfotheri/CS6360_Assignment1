# CS6360_Assignment1

Notes for Assignment 1_1
- Movement in xy can be done using the left joystick of an xbox controller
- We use the OVRCameraRig because the OVRPlayerController was giving us problems
- We lost the collider functionality with the sphere which previously worked with OVRPlayerController
- The rest of the controls are on the wall

Notes for Assignment 1_2
- We did not create any custom rooms in CAD software
- The left joystick of the sbox controller does xy movement
- You must be in the light almost to get the point
 
We have both contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
